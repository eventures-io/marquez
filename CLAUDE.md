# CLAUDE.md

This project is extending the Marquez front-end with added functionality. For the new screens we use react-flow instead of the custom components from the original graphs. 

## Development Constraints

**IMPORTANT**: When working on this codebase, only modify files in the `web/src/routes/dataset-lineage*` directories. Do not modify or create files in other directories unless explicitly requested.

## Development Notes

- Don't ask to run the server. Consider it to be already running.
